        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Starting the Game:</strong> To start the game, click the
            "New game" button. This initializes the game and resets all scores
            to zero.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Taking Turns:</strong>
            <p>Players take turns rolling the dice:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Click the "Roll dice" button to roll the die.</li>
              <li>
                Each roll adds the number on the die to the player's current
                score.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a player rolls a 1, their current score resets to zero, and
                their turn ends.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a player rolls a 0, their current score remains unchanged,
                and their turn continues.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Winning the Game:</strong> The game continues until one
            player reaches or exceeds the winning score. The first player to
            reach or exceed the winning score is declared the winner.
          </li>
